List of ToDo's...

1)  Finish styling/coding the TaskType View.
 x a) put together client, server, and database test cases.
 x b) replace the save button with a glyphicon.
      i) went with a fixed size save button.
   c) i have a bug on the task page with the client edits; see if you can recreate it.
      i) it has something to do with blank spaces and then tabbing out, or
         causing the error some how and then not being able to clear it by tabbing back
         in...
 x d) i have what looks to be a cashing bug between Task and Task Type view.
      i) it is creating records that were deleted prior.
        I) SOLUTION:  It looks like the end points that add data are getting called.  When I route
                      specifically to the Task Type view, I don't get the same behavior.


2)  Start working on the TimeCard View.
   a) it looks like the date_worked field on the time_card table needs to not be unique.
   b) i'm going to algorithmically determine what the dates should be for the days of the
      week on the time card view.  Either by defaulting to today's date, and or, using a
      date picker from a calendar of some kind...
